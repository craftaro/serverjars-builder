# What's this?
This is an OpenSource project for [ServerJars](https://serverjars.com/) that will be in charge of building **every single jar** available in our site.

# How does it work?!?
Magic âœ¨...<br/>
Actually it's just a bunch of Kotlin code (don't tell anyone, but I think I'm in love with Kotlin... but don't tell Swift!!).<br/>
You're free to check out our code! But if you use it make sure to take a look to our license!

But how does it actually work?! Well, it's pretty simple, we have a model 'SoftwareBuilder', which is 
implemented by our different services, like the PaperService, or PurpurService, then the system goes through
all the services (or just the ones you specified to build) and asynchronously builds them, then it 
uploads them to the storage service.

# How can I help?
Feel free to clone this repo and make some changes, then open a PR and done! Someone from the team will check it out and if it meets our âœ¨High standardsâœ¨ (actually, it just needs to work and be pretty :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) we'll merge it!

# How can I run it?
You can run it locally, but you'll need to have Docker installed and running.<br/>
Then, just run `./gradlew run` and it should work! I hope so... Hmm, it seems it prints just a help page, welp, I guess if you're reading this... you can also READ THE HELP PAGE! Sorry for screaming, I just put a lot of work in that help page, actually, it was GitHub Copilot (_thanks copilot_)

# How do I compile it?
Just run `./gradlew shadowJar` and it should just export a jar file to `build/libs/ServerJars.jar`.<br/>
Then you can run it with `java -jar ServerJars.jar` and it should work! Probably, if not your computer will explode in 5..4..3..2..1.. ðŸ’¥.... Hmm, didn't work, I guess it just runs the jar file :sweat_smile:<br/>

# How do I configure my `.env`?
It's easy, here's a table with all the variables you can use, and their description:
